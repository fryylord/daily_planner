## Solution for Module 5 Challenge

This site has been created as an interactive planner allowing for tasks to be saved for each hour of the work day.  As the day goes on, the current hour is highlighted red, with future hours colored green and past hours being shaded grey.  The user can input text for each hour, and if selecting the save button, the data will be saved in local storage and return upon reload.
